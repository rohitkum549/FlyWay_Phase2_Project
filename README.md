# FlyWay_Phase2_Project
Simplilearn Project
Project objective: 
As a Full Stack Developer, design and develop an airline booking portal named as FlyAway. Use the GitHub repository to manage the project artifacts. 

# Background of the problem statement:
FlyAway is a ticket-booking portal that lets people book flights on their website.

# The website needs to have the following features:

● A search form in the homepage to allow entry of travel details, like the date of travel, source, destination, and the number of persons.
 

# For the above features to work, there will be an admin backend with the following features:

● An admin login page where the admin can change the password after login, if he wishes
● A master list of places for source and destination
● A master list of airlines
● A list of flights where each flight has a source, destination, airline, and ticket price
     
The goal of the company is to deliver a high-end quality product as early as possible. 

# The flow and features of the application:

● Plan more than two sprints to complete the application
● Document the flow of the application and prepare a flow chart 
● List the core concepts and algorithms being used to complete this application
● Implement the appropriate concepts, such as exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization and increased performance
● Eclipse/IntelliJ: An IDE to code for the application 
● Java: A programming language to develop the web pages, databases, and others
● SQL: To create tables for admin, airlines, and other specifics
● Maven: To create a web-enabled Maven project
● Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub 
● GitHub: To store the application code and track its versions 
● Scrum: An efficient agile framework to deliver the product incrementally 
● Search and Sort techniques: Data structures used for the project 
● Specification document: Any open-source document or Google Docs
