# FlyWay_Phase2_Project
Simplilearn Project
Project objective: 
As a Full Stack Developer, design and develop an airline booking portal named as FlyAway. Use the GitHub repository to manage the project artifacts. 

# Background of the problem statement:
FlyAway is a ticket-booking portal that lets people book flights on their website.

# The website needs to have the following features:
 
*  A search form in the homepage to allow entry of travel details, like the date of travel, source, destination, and the number of persons.
*  Based on the travel details entered, it will show the available flights with their ticket prices.
*  Once a person selects a flight to book, they will be taken to a register page where they must fill in their personal details
*  In the next page, they are shown the flight details of the flight that they are booking.
*  And the payment is done via a dummy payment gateway.
*  On completion of the payment, they are shown a confirmation page with the details of the booking.   
*  An admin login page where the admin can change the password after login, if he wishes.
*  A list of flights where each flight has a source, destination, airline, and ticket price.
# The flow and features of the application:
* Plan more than two sprints to complete the application.
* Document the flow of the application and prepare a flow chart.
* List the core concepts and algorithms being used to complete this application.
# I used the following Things:
* Eclipse/IntelliJ: An IDE to code for the application.
* Java: A programming language to develop the web pages, databases, and others
* SQL: To create tables for admin, airlines, and other specifics.
* Maven: To create a web-enabled Maven project
